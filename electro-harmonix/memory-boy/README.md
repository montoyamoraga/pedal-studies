## notes

analog delay

optional expression pedal input allowing control over delay time or modulation rate.

it takes approximately 20 seconds to fully warm up.

delay knob: range is 30 ms to 550 ms. if you turn it while in use, it will bend the pitch. the delay know also sets the maximum delay time for expression pedal control.

depth knob: sets the amount of modulation that is applied to the delayed signal.

blend knob: controls the balance between wet and dry signal.

feedback knob: controls the amount of signal that is circulated from the output of the delay block to its input.

triangle / square toggle switch: sets the shape of the analog modulation waveform.

chorus, vibrato and expression pedal toggle switch: three-position dual function togge switch has two jobs: it sets the modulation rate and chooses the parameter for the expression pedal to control. with nothing plugged into the expression pedal, you have three modulation rates: chorus for slow rate, expression pedal for medium rate, vibrate for a fast rate. when the expression pedal is connected, chorus and vibrato remains the same, and expression pedal allows for use of the pedal extending past the two rates set by chorus and vibrato.

epxression pedal control: when the switch is set to either chorus or vibrato modes, the expression pedal controls delay time. when it is set to expression pedal, it controls the modulation rate. the shortest delay time is toe up position, the longest delay time is toe down position.
