## notes

power supply: any 9V center negative Boss-style regulated power supply. plug shoudld have 2.1mm inside diameter and 5.5mm outside diameter. retrieved from https://support.redpandalab.com/support/solutions/articles/43000020227-which-power-supply-should-i-use-with-red-panda-pedals- on 2022-06-30.

power draw: the Particle V1 draws 85 mA. retrieved from https://support.redpandalab.com/support/solutions/articles/43000668245-what-are-the-power-requirements-of-the-particle-v1- on 2022-06-30.

audio quality: 24-bit 32 kHz ADCs and DACs, Spin FV-1 processor, 24-bit fixed point processing, low noise and distortion Burr-Brown op amps, mono input and mono output. retrieved from https://support.redpandalab.com/support/solutions/articles/43000663591-what-is-the-audio-quality-of-your-pedals- on 2022-06-30.

recommended expression pedal: 10 - 50 kOhm linear potentiometer with a 1/4" TRS plug with return voltage on tip, pedal-supplied voltage on ring, ground on sleeve. you can use Mission Engineering EP-1, Moog EP-3 with the switch on the bottom set to "STANDARD" and the maximum value know on the right fully clockwise, or Roland EV-5 with the minimum value knob fully counter-clockwise. retrieved from https://support.redpandalab.com/support/solutions/articles/43000020211-which-expression-pedals-work-with-red-panda-products- on 2022-06-30.

replacement knobs for Particle V1: the knobs are designed for 1/4" round potentiometer shafts and have set screws for fastening. for small knobs 16/x14mm with set screw: Eagle 450-2034-GRX (Mouser), and for large knob 20/16mm with set screw : Eagle 450-2035-GRX (Mouser). retrieved from https://support.redpandalab.com/support/solutions/articles/43000668522-replacement-knobs-for-particle-v1 on 2022-06-30.

control voltage: you can use CV with the expression pedal CTRL jack. pedal expects voltage 0-3.3V on the tip and sleeve grounded. the expression input has current limiting in case you use a TS cable, but it is preferrable to use a 1/4" TRS cable with the ring unconnected. another option is to use the Expert Sleepers floating ring cable. retrieved from https://support.redpandalab.com/support/solutions/articles/43000020214-can-i-use-control-voltages-cv-with-the-expression-pedal-ctrl-jack- on 2022-06-30.

sequencer: you  can use an Electro-Harmonix 8 Step Program with Red Panda Lab pedals, since they use a 0-3.3V control range, and you can connect with a TRS to TRS cable to the CTRL expression input. retrieved from https://support.redpandalab.com/support/solutions/articles/43000570220-can-i-use-an-electro-harmonix-8-step-program-with-red-panda-pedals- on 2022-06-30.
