* right toggle switch: dry-mute selector that selects whether dry signal is muted or not when stutter effect is activated, mute (left) or pass (right).
* left knob: effect time/length: in random mode sets maximum possible stutter length, in fixed mode sets stutter length between extremely short and nearly one second.
* right knob: effect volume, sets the volume of the stutter effect. the volume of the dry signal is fixed.
* left footswitch: bypass, true-bypass, entirely removes the effect from your signal path.
